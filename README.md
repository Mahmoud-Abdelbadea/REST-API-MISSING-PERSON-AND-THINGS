### Brief about the graduation project

This application is a way to show the missing person to other people
through his photo and a set of data that may help find him, and you
can help to find the missing people.
And artificial intelligence has become an interesting matter and made
life easier, so we made it easy for you to search by searching by
pictures. If the person is already present, his data will appear in front
of you, and if he is not present, you can add him to be found.
#### Brief about search by image
In order to search by image, we created an api using Python by creating Algorithm
to compare the similarity between the searched image and the image in the database.
We also linked the Python api to the Nodejs api.
